# SPSS .NET Interop library

[![Build status](https://andrewarnott.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/_apis/public/build/definitions/c4c7c7c9-74aa-4d88-9a4b-6f4b9e79002a/2/badge)](https://andrewarnott.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/GitHub/_build#)

A .NET library for read/writing SPSS Data (.sav) files. This wraps the functionality exposed by the spssio32.dll native library that comes with SPSS.

[SPSS][1] is a statistical software application popular among students and researchers.

Recently updated to include spssio32.dll from SPSS 15 and to work with that version and possibly later versions.

See also the [SPSSLib][2] CodePlex project which has the same goals as this project, but without using spssio32.dll
